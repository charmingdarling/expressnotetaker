# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Your Task

We were to modify starter code to create a Note Taker application that could be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js on the backend and will save, retrieve, and delete note data from a JSON file. We were already given front end starter code. 

Our ultimate task was to merge the two entities to communicate with each other, and then deploy the whole application to Heroku.

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
